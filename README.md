- **Image Module**: Provides robust image operations (listing, downloading, deletion)
- **Photo Module**: Controls photo capture with warm-up sequence

### Enhanced Image Viewing

Our improved image viewing system now supports multiple URL formats for maximum compatibility with different Olympus camera models:

- **Auto-detection**: Automatically detects which URL format works with your specific camera
- **Error Recovery**: Gracefully handles 404/520 errors by trying alternative formats
- **High Resolution**: Option to load higher resolution versions of images
- **Cache Management**: Efficient caching system to improve performance

### Diagnostic Tools

The application now includes powerful diagnostic capabilities:

- **API Explorer**: Systematically tests different camera endpoints to identify supported features
- **Enhanced Logging**: Comprehensive logging system with emoji indicators for better readability
- **URL Format Testing**: Tests multiple URL formats to determine what works with your camera
- **Connection Analysis**: Provides detailed information about connection quality and status

### Live View Performance

The live view streaming has been optimized for higher performance:

- **Improved Buffer Management**: Optimized buffer allocation for smoother video
- **Enhanced Frame Processing**: Better RTP protocol handling for more reliable streaming
- **Adaptive Frame Rate**: Dynamically adjusts frame processing based on system capabilities
- **Robust Error Recovery**: Automatically recovers from streaming disruptions
- **Player Integration**: Better integration with external players (MPlayer/FFplay)

## Technical Details

### Wireless Image Viewing

- **Resolution Options**: Low, medium, and high resolution options to balance quality and speed
- **Multiple Display Methods**: Support for various terminal image display methods (iTerm2, Kitty, SIXEL, etc.)
- **Zoom Functionality**: Dynamically adjust zoom level with real-time feedback
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows with appropriate fallbacks

### Live View and Recording

- **Stream Format**: MJPEG stream used for live viewing with optimized encoding
- **Viewer Integration**: Utilizes `mplayer` with performance-optimized parameters
- **Recording**: Optionally pipe the stream to a file for recording purposes
- **Fallbacks**: Automatic player selection with fallback options (FFplay)

```

### Using Image Viewer

Navigate to the "View Images" option in the main menu and press Enter to see the list of images on your camera. Select an image and press Enter to view it.

Controls:

- `+`/`-` - Zoom in/out
- `0` - Reset zoom
- `r` - Load higher resolution version
- `d` - Cycle display methods (for different terminals)
- `a` - Toggle aspect ratio preservation
- `Enter` - Display full image using external viewer

- Esc - Go back to previous screen

### API Exploration

In debug mode, you can use the API exploration feature to diagnose which camera endpoints and URL formats work with your specific camera model:

1. From the image list, press `a` to start API exploration
2. Check the logs to see which endpoints succeed or fail
3. Use this information to understand your camera's capabilities

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with image loading (404 or 520 errors):

1. Run in debug mode: `./run.sh --debug`
2. Use the API exploration feature to determine supported endpoints
3. Check logs for successful URL formats
4. Ensure your camera's firmware is up to date
